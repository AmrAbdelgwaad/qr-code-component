# Frontend Mentor - QR code component
![the design](desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first project in front-end mentor that I do all by myself from start to finish,
two months ago I wasn't able to do this simple project because I go through poor resources but now 
thanks to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) I finished this project easily and I am willing
to do much more projects inshallah 

i use this [webite](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) to generate the box-shadow

any comments and pieces of advice about this project are welcomed thanks.
